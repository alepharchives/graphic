Fix + StockDB + Graphic integration demo app

Main module bringing them all together is graphic_quotes_demo. Look how it works if you are interested.


To build, execute
   ./rebar get-deps compile

To configure, copy fix_src.conf.example to fix_src.conf and edit it to specify your fix connection info.

To run demo:
   ERL_LIBS=deps erl -s graphic_demo start


Demo page with stock data (saved earlier and current updates) will be available at
   http://localhost:8880/graphic_demo?stock=NASDAQ.AAPL
(Of course, you may specify any other stock accessible with your FIX account)


Known problems:
   On first run graphs do not display. We beleive it is HighStocks trouble. Just reload page after graph navigator changes.
